## What do you look for when you trade

- time and sales
- l2
- price action
- vol
- where price is
- poc (point of control)
- vwap
- pace of tape

**ALL** of this combined is the tape

## What else do you look at?

(ask yourself these questions)

- When price falls, is there interest bidding it up?
- Are there patient buyers waiting?
how far has price retraced from balance?
- Is price looking for discovery?
- Is it overextended?

## How do I learn about Orderflow?

Axios and Jigsaw Trading YT videos

## Favorite Catch Phrase?

Stunningly Simple

## How long have you been trading?

1.5 years (as of june/2021)

## How big is your portfolio?

It’s big enough, don’t worry about it

## How to know when to trim for profits vs add to runners?

Everyone trades differently, you can also just buy and hold positions
that works \

\
A strong stock will show you it’s strong

(1) having a large green print on tape does NOT mean it was a bid on ToS at least, green prints occur when the order comes in at the same time as when price moves to the upside and vice versa w/ red prints

     you want to watch what price is doing relative to these orders whether price bids above or below that print in the given time frame

    if there is a confluence of price action, price, and tape = good

 

(2) pace of tape shows interest or lack of interest from market participants, filter according to average sized lots being traded to reduce as much noise as possible

 

(3) always watch price in relation to what is being printed

 

(4) large prints AH, i dont really look at these tbh, dont really find use in the large orders AH, only thing that really matters is during RTH (regular trading hours)

 

(5) large prints but away from b/a, likely delayed dark pool prints, again i dont really look at this

 

(6) how clean or thick the tape is, clean would be heavy selling or heavy buying w/ clear imbalance of the buyer or seller side w/ respect to price action and price

       thickness comes when you have a tape full of heavy sellers and heavy buyers or buyers trying to push price up but met w/ a good amount of selling as well

 

(7) at the end of the day, pace of tape, price action, price, sizable orders and volume is what is really what you're looking at to make trading decisions

      figure out who's in control and flow w/ them

 

 

orderflow footprint keywords and concepts to understand (i.e look up)

 

- Reversal patterns

    - order flow imbalances

    - delta divergence

    - exhaustion

    - absorption

    - footprint color changes

    - finished auctions

    - cluster prints

    - FPBS - delta changes

- Trending Patterns

    - cumulative delta (d-bars, delta bars)

    - delta momentum

    - footprint color confirmation

    - delta day (volume study)

- See inside the chart

    - Thin Spots

    - triggering of stops

    - power of '3'

    - footprint filter

    - unfinished auction

    - naked PoC

    - delta price levels

    - orderflow pivots

    - volume magnets

    - shape of profile

 

"As the volume keeps increasing by N = number of times a new order comes in (times someone — human or algos— take a trade), the more pronounced the shape becomes, with the creation of another universal truth in statistics, that is, standard deviations. This states that over 68% of the volume will be accumulated under 1 standard deviation (in blue), while 95% of the volume will come within 2 standard deviations (in red). Now you will understand why the standard market value of a volume profile tends to be 70%."

 

1. Point of Control (PoC): It refers to the area in the chart with the most traded volume activity. This is by far the most relevant area you want to monitor as it can help to define the placement of your stops or the areas in the chart where you might find the most pristine entry levels. The highest concentrated area of volume for a particular period of time we will call it PoC or Point of Control and you will be surprised how many times it acts as a wall on a retest. Traders tend to factor this in as an area of support or resistance.

2. High Volume Nodes (HVN): Sub-sequences in the chart with high volume activity. While not as powerful nor symbolic as the PoC, the HVN is also a powerful area as it also represents increased trading activity.

3. Value Area (VA): The range of price levels in which a specified percentage of all volume was traded. By default, the industry standards tends to be 70%. Once I explain the principle of the distribution curve below, it will become much clearer why the default number is the 70%, bear with me.

 

No option sweeps, just trade ideas

 

Scanner that scans for movement in market based on relative volume and upticks in short time frame

 

When I’m looking at those, that’s my “shopping” lens when I start browsing for setups

 

I always monitor tape on ES, NQ, SPY, TSLA, the broader market basically to gauge a bullish or bearish bias

 

If nothing to trade, there’s nothing to trade

 

On my active account, I always close 90%+ in cash so I have 0 emotional attachment or bias towards a position and strictly trade what the session offers

 

 

(1) overcrowded

(2) theta burn

(3) not a good chart for options

 

From that perspective, I do not trade the options

 

Again, I trade strictly on the chart

 

Option purchases are always typically either ATM or ITM to have a leveraged directional bias for scalping

 

When I do OTM, I believe there’s the statistical side is w/ me and I’m willing to take the risk of it running into ITM, but always buy w/ time

 

(1) what does the chart look like, daily, intraday, r/r ,what time of day

(2) what is the r/r above and below, how is the tape, is there intraday accumulation im seeing (that's always good)

(3) how are current market conditions, are they favorable towards longs or bears or balance

(4) time, longer times likely lead to more OTM like PLBY for exmaple, i saw 50 on it's head when it bidded back near to the 40s now 48

(5) target, what is my upper, lower, limit

(6) premiums, are they inflated, how is IV, what am i paying for, what time of day am i paying for, am i paying for juiced IV

(7) spreads, are they tight? if not, then the chart + orderflow must outweigh the spreads because io've had positions go from wide spreads to tight spreads due to increased demand

(8) what is the OI and Volume and IV

(9) tape, is it clean, is it chopy, is it weird, how does tape look, is it more buys, hidden sellers?

 

 

Pure TA is speculative imo, used for exit and entries

 

Tape comes first, it precedes candlesticks and quantifies what the hell is going on in your candles

 

Market profile for visual representation of where you are on the treasure map + to see pivots

 

Volume profile to see gaps or supply demand zones

 

Orderflow (tape) to see who’s in control and who’s buying or selling

 

DOM (depth of market) see where buyers and sellers are sitting at on the market

 

Volume to gauge interest

 

Indices and levels of other stocks for leading indicators (they have a relationship with each other)

 

Price action IS important as well

 

Velocity of tape to gauge changes volume
